Quaternions For A Third Grader

\begin_layout Standard
Third graders enjoy clay and pipe cleaners.
 It might sound cruel to teach them graduate level graph theory most math
 Ph.D.’s have not seen, but I might get away with it if I uses the right craft
 supplies.

 Children are right to skeptical, as I expect of my reader.

 While I have watched Elmo count four ducks, four birds of a feather, a
 few hundred times, I have not seen him do any multiplication.
 No doubt this would be the first step:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clay ball is the vertex

, the pipe cleaner is an edge.
 Both are labelled.
 Vertex 1 times edge 1 brings us back to vertex 1.
 This sounds too simple.
 I recognize that few of the esteemed readers here are still in third grade,
 rare that a school would hold back a pupil for decades, although if you
 are that special, I apologize.

The next step for Elmo

 that are far, far to difficult to ever understand even as a post-doc.
 Yet children do have great imaginations, so they should be naturals with
 imaginary numbers.

 No visible difference at the clay and pipe cleaner level between real

 If you have, you will know what a pain in the ass it is to get those two
 pipe cleaners to go into the one hole in the clay.
 I had to tie a little piece of string around a little pair of pipe cleaners,
 tie a tiny knot, clip off the extra, all without knocking down the delicate
 structure.
 Once you have done this 12 times, you say, “Fuck these two pipe cleaners”
 (hopefully without the kids in earshot).

 That one failure is enough to avoid them as people avoid people with leprosy.
 But I worked on leprosy the disease.
 One of few lines of a technical paper I can quote goes: “Research over
 the past 100 years to infect people with leprosy

 have failed.” Much to the tremendous pleasure of the people coerced into
 the studies! People are visual, not so analytic.
 Leprosy is the most visually damaging disease, and thus the most feared.
 But the mycobateria that causes it does not jump from person to person
 with any efficiency whatsoever.
 It is thought that if a person has a genetic flaw, and much repeated exposure,
 then they have a chance of picking up this slow growing bacilli that is
 easily treated with sulfur drugs.
 Only if you are really unlucky, really poor, could you get Hansen’s disease,
 and then have to be unlucky and poor not to have it treated effectively.
 Two or three million people fall into this class worldwide.

 Let the two graphs presented here be a counter argument.
 Quaternions cannot do it all, the hypercomplex numbers are just as vital.

 exactly half the signs change.

 tire of the strain, the answer is on a preprint server.

 (photons are devilishly clever).
 At the detector box, the experimentalist makes a choice: see if the photon
 took the down path, or the up path, or both paths as would be needed to
 see an interference pattern.
 The decision about what type of measurement to do is delayed until after
 the photon has passed by the beam splitter (technically, a spacelike separation
 is required).
 Wheeler argued that the odd logic of quantum mechanics

 People will nod along with the statement that intensity is not relevant
 to quantum processes.
 The consequence of the statement is that lowering the intensity to one
 photon a day does not change an effect except to slow the rate the experimental
ist collects data.

 Photons are isolationists, whether as solitary skaters in this experiment,
 or if sent as a swarm of a billion a second.
 The photons never hold hands or work together.
 Looking at a quantum effect one photon at a time is a red herring.
 People love their herrings and will defend their right to focus on the

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Gedanken Experiment.
 In this experiment, the configuration of a two-path interferometer is chosen
 after a single-photon pulse has entered it: either the interferometer is
 closed (i.e.
 the two paths are recombined) and the interference is observed, or the
 interferometer remains open and the path followed by the photon is measured.
 We report an almost ideal realization of that Gedanken Experiment, where
 the light pulses are true single photons
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
photon!single
\end_layout

\end_inset

, allowing unambiguous which-way measurements, and the interferometer, which
 has two spatially separated paths, produces high visibility interference.
 The choice between measuring either the 'open' or 'closed' configuration
 is made by a quantum random number generator, and is space-like separated
 -- in the relativistic sense -- from the entering of the photon into the
 interferometer.
 Measurements in the closed configuration show interference with a visibility
 of 94%, while measurements in the open configuration allow us to determine
 the followed path with an error probability lower than 1%.

 The Turn is when things disappear that should not be able to vanish.
 The audience is confused, nervous that something may have gone wrong.
 The work for the illusionist happens at the third step: the Prestige, when
 the missing thing is brought back, completely unharmed.

 No wonder this is tricky! (one technical detail: for the way my software

quantum interference.
 Instead I can point out why these images are a challenge.
 Time is a scalar, space is a vector.
 In quantum mechanics, the scalar is not a dull, monotonically increasing
 function.
 Instead, time toys with space, but mapping it back into the same space,
 thus hiding its hand.
 I needed to take what was only happening between time and one dimension
 of space and use another dimension to get a better handle on what was happening.

"What does one plus equal?" That is good English, math gibberish.

.
 Poorly formed questions can never be answered.
 "Was there a photon at this location and at this time?" is a well-formed
 question.
 If you know exactly when a photon is seen, then a second prior to being
 detected you can make a statement about where it was, no matter what detector
 was used.
 Say the beam splitter
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 was 2 light seconds away from the detector.
 Then there is a 50-50 chance the photon was at the half-way point of the
 up or the down path.
 If the down detector saw the photon, then the photon was at the half-way
 point in the down path.
 Notice I said both time and space locations.
 The photon was not in some arbitrary place along the down path a light
 second before detection.

 If the interference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 was at the maximal destructive point, then there was definitely no photon
 at the halfway point in either branch.
 For interference value between these two extremes, it sets the odds on
 a photon being at the halfway point a light second before being detected.

I recall gripping my red pen and wondering why I was so angry at Alf? Science
 is a collection of theories well-supported by experimental data.
 We didn't have any issues with the theories or the scientific process.
 Where we differed is what I call scientific beliefs

: these are the implications beyond the scope of the theory itself, beliefs
 that create views of meaning in the Universe.
 I now appreciate why scientists can totally not stand each other: it is
 less the science, and more the extension and implications of the work that
 leads to animated disagreements.
 That lesson was worth the red ink.

 Everything obeys the same gravitational law.

 The weak equivalence principle is easy to get along with, just end up with
